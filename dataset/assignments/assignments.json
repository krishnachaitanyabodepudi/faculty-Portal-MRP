    "description": "This assignment requires you to demonstrate your understanding of the fundamental concepts introduced in the first part of the course. You will analyze key theoretical frameworks, apply them to specific problems, and critically evaluate their implications.\n\nThe assignment consists of three main components. First, you must provide a comprehensive explanation of the core concepts, demonstrating both breadth and depth of understanding. This should include definitions, relationships between concepts, and their historical development. Second, you will apply these concepts to solve a series of problems or analyze case studies. Your solutions should show clear reasoning, proper methodology, and accurate application of theoretical knowledge. Third, you will write a critical reflection on the limitations and potential extensions of these concepts, drawing connections to real-world applications or current research.\n\nYour work should be well-organized, clearly written, and properly cited. You are expected to use multiple sources beyond the textbook, including peer-reviewed articles, reputable online resources, and relevant examples from current practice. The assignment should demonstrate your ability to synthesize information from various sources and present it in a coherent and professional manner.",

    "description": "This assignment requires you to demonstrate your understanding of the fundamental concepts introduced in the first part of the course. You will analyze key theoretical frameworks, apply them to specific problems, and critically evaluate their implications.\n\nThe assignment consists of three main components. First, you must provide a comprehensive explanation of the core concepts, demonstrating both breadth and depth of understanding. This should include definitions, relationships between concepts, and their historical development. Second, you will apply these concepts to solve a series of problems or analyze case studies. Your solutions should show clear reasoning, proper methodology, and accurate application of theoretical knowledge. Third, you will write a critical reflection on the limitations and potential extensions of these concepts, drawing connections to real-world applications or current research.\n\nYour work should be well-organized, clearly written, and properly cited. You are expected to use multiple sources beyond the textbook, including peer-reviewed articles, reputable online resources, and relevant examples from current practice. The assignment should demonstrate your ability to synthesize information from various sources and present it in a coherent and professional manner.",

    "description": "This assignment requires you to demonstrate your understanding of the fundamental concepts introduced in the first part of the course. You will analyze key theoretical frameworks, apply them to specific problems, and critically evaluate their implications.\n\nThe assignment consists of three main components. First, you must provide a comprehensive explanation of the core concepts, demonstrating both breadth and depth of understanding. This should include definitions, relationships between concepts, and their historical development. Second, you will apply these concepts to solve a series of problems or analyze case studies. Your solutions should show clear reasoning, proper methodology, and accurate application of theoretical knowledge. Third, you will write a critical reflection on the limitations and potential extensions of these concepts, drawing connections to real-world applications or current research.\n\nYour work should be well-organized, clearly written, and properly cited. You are expected to use multiple sources beyond the textbook, including peer-reviewed articles, reputable online resources, and relevant examples from current practice. The assignment should demonstrate your ability to synthesize information from various sources and present it in a coherent and professional manner.",

You will select a topic related to the course material, conduct a comprehensive literature review, and write a research paper that contributes to the existing body of knowledge.\n\nBegin by identifying a specific research question or problem within the course domain. This should be a topic that interests you and has sufficient scholarly literature available. Conduct a thorough literature review using academic databases, identifying at least 15-20 peer-reviewed sources. Your literature review should not merely summarize sources but should synthesize them, identify themes, gaps in current research, and establish the context for your own analysis.\n\nYour research paper should include: an introduction that establishes the research question and its significance; a comprehensive literature review section; a methodology section describing your approach to analysis; a results/discussion section presenting your findings and analysis; and a conclusion that summarizes your contributions and suggests directions for future research. You should demonstrate critical thinking by evaluating different perspectives, identifying strengths and weaknesses in existing research, and proposing novel insights or connections.",
